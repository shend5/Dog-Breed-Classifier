# Dog-Breed-Classifier

## Convolutional Neural Networks Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App

In this notebook, We create an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app.
At the end of this project, the code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.
If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. The image below displays potential sample output of the finished project.

1. Download the [dog](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip) dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/dogImages.

2. Download the [human](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip) dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/lfw

3. Download the [VGG-16](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) bottleneck features for the dog dataset. Place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features.
